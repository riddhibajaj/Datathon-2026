# Access to Care: Forecasting Unmet Healthcare Need in the U.S.

**Trends, disparities, and a 2025 projection of cost-related delayed and missed care using national survey data (2019–2024)**

This project was developed as part of **Datathon 2026** and analyzes national survey data to understand cost-related barriers to healthcare access in the United States. The analysis examines historical trends, subgroup disparities, and forecasts unmet healthcare need for 2025.

## Project Overview

* Focuses on **cost-related delayed or unmet care**, including delayed medical care, unmet medical care, unmet mental health care, and cost-related medication nonadherence.
* Uses data from **2019–2024**, excluding unreliable estimates.
* Aggregates subgroup estimates to national-level trends using **inverse-variance weighting**.
* Forecasts unmet care for **2025** using **Holt’s additive Exponential Smoothing**, selected for transparency and suitability for short, non-seasonal time series.
* Includes **confidence intervals** to reflect both survey uncertainty and forecasting error.

## Key Outputs

* National trend estimates (2019–2024)
* 2025 forecast of unmet healthcare need with 95% CI
* Subgroup disparity analysis (e.g., disability status, race/ethnicity, income, sexual orientation)
* Visualizations highlighting **where care breaks down** and **invisible barriers to access**

## Notes

This project is intended for exploratory and policy-relevant analysis and should not be interpreted as causal inference. Results provide a data-driven baseline for monitoring access-to-care trends beyond 2025.
